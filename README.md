# adaptablegrid
The Adaptable Grid is a JavaScript based grid control.

It contains all the functionality that users expect in a basic grid and has a well-written API allowing developers easily to add their own filtering, sorting and searching functionality as required.

The Adaptable Grid works particularly well with the Adaptable Blotter (it was written with the Adaptable Blotter in mind) but is also available as a standalone grid.

The Adaptable Grid is free to use.
